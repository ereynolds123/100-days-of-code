# 100 Days Of Code - Log April 25, 2020 to July 31, 2020

### Day 0: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to start this #100daysofcode challenge. I read all the FAQs, set up my repository, joined slack. (None of this counted towards my hour). I spent my time getting my current projects up on github and making my commits. I worked on HCC app and began the Javascript of the app. The Javascript I added was the pseudo-code for the app, the states and the boiler plate code. I fixed the architecture of HCC. 

**Thoughts:** I am excited to start this project! I am excited to focus on projects because I think this is where you learn. I am still struggling with github and siteground. I am unsure how to add websites from HTML/CSS/Javascript on siteground. I am unsure how to create github pages from a folder. I am trying to determine how I want to organize my repositories. Like, should I start a repository for every project I do? How do I commit changes? I really need to go back and watch his video about github. The Javascript pseudo-code was useful because it helped me figure out where I was going. I also added similar code that is a template for the app.

**Time spent**: 6 hours


### Day 1: April 26

**Today's Progress**: Added room functionality and inventory to Zorkington game. Questioned about game input on Facebook and Stack overflow. 

**Thoughts**: I am still very confused about how to add user input to the game. The room states made sense, but I am not sure if the inventory is correct. So far, it is not throwing errors so it seems ok.

**Time spent**: 4 hours

### Day 2: April 27

**Today's Progress**: Added validActions functionality so people can do different actions in different rooms. 

**Thoughts**: I think today went ok. There are a bunch of errors though that I need to figure out. I have a really hard time with syntax. I think this is the hardest thing for me. I think I need to work in step by step and test things out. But it is hard when some pieces of the program need variables and things to allow them to do different things.

**Time spent**: 5 hours

### Day 3: April 28

**Today's Progress**: Made the walking around functionality work in Zork. The setup is pretty much complete, now I got to tie it together with function. 

**Thoughts**: Today went pretty well. But that is only because I used Josh's code pretty close. But I was pretty close myself so I feel good about that.  Tonight we have class, so hopefully that is helpful. I am starting to not hate coding, it is VERY challenging, but I actually like it. It allows you to do cool things. I think I still prefer Wordpress, but this adds a layer of being able to do things.

**Time spent**: 5 hours

### Day 4: April 29

**Today's Progress**: Made the questions and functionality for Zork. It is pretty much finished, though it has some bugs. I also did a Bibliography for myself in HTML. 

**Thoughts**: The Zork game is pretty impossibly difficult. Maybe I will get it the second time around. The HTML felt like an absolute walk in the park. So easy. Maybe I should code more sites from scratch. 

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/zorkington-ereynolds123 commit 11 and https://github.com/ereynolds123/practice commit 1

**Time spent**: 1 hours
