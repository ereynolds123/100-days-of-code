# 100 Days Of Code - Log April 25, 2020 to July 31, 2020

### Day 0: April 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to start this #100daysofcode challenge. I read all the FAQs, set up my repository, joined slack. (None of this counted towards my hour). I spent my time getting my current projects up on github and making my commits. I worked on HCC app and began the Javascript of the app. The Javascript I added was the pseudo-code for the app, the states and the boiler plate code. 

**Thoughts:** I am excited to start this project! I am excited to focus on projects because I think this is where you learn. I am still struggling with github and siteground. I am unsure how to add websites from HTML/CSS/Javascript on siteground. I am unsure how to create github pages from a folder. I am trying to determine how I want to organize my repositories. Like, should I start a repository for every project I do? How do I commit changes? I really need to go back and watch his video about github. The Javascript pseudo-code was useful because it helped me figure out where I was going. I also added similar code that is a template for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
